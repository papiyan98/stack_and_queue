# Stack and Queue data structures
Stack is a LIFO data structure. That means which data is last come in, that will be first go out. Stack's have push and pop methods respectively for adding and removing data from Stack, and isEmpty method which check is stack empty or not.

Queue is a FIFO data strucurue. That means which data is first come in, that will be first go out. Queue's have enQueue and deQueue methods respectively for adding and removing data from queue, and isEmpty method which check is queue empty or not.

Stack's and Queue's are simple data structures, but they play big role in implementation of other data structures and in some algorithms.
